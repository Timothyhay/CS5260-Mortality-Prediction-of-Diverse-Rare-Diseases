# CS5260-Mortality-Prediction-of-Diverse-Rare-Diseases
Few-Shot Learning with Similar Tasks via MOE for Mortality Prediction of Diverse Rare Diseases 

## Progress

- At present, 2 baselines: LSTM and Transformer have been implemented

- Trying MOE-LSTM to see if we can finally perform follow-up analysis of various disease clusters from the MOE representation

- Completed experiments with 5 different seeds on LSTM and Transformer, record relevant experimental data and training history.
